Change Directory Set/Go             Last Update Sept 20/93
by Glen Little

Quick Intro:
This package was put together to address a particular problem.  Often, while
using a command prompt, I am in a subdirectory many levels deep when I
realize that I want to switch from DOS to OS/2 or vice versa.

With this package in place, I can simply type  CDS xxxx  from any prompt. Then
switch to the prompt I want to use and type  CDG xxxx  to move to the same
directory.

This is also a simple quick change directory command to any directory you have
previously stored. You can use any nickname you like for each directory.


Contents:
  READ.ME      This file...
---------------DOS files
  CDS.BAT      CD Save
  CDG.EXE      CD Go
  CDG.PAS      CD Go Pascal source
  CDLIST.EXE   CD List
  CDLIST.PAS   CD List Pascal source
---------------OS/2 files
  CDS.CMD      CD Save
  CDG.CMD      CD Go
  CDLIST.CMD   CD List


Installation:
  1. Add a line like this to CONFIG.SYS and each AUTOEXEC.BAT
	SET CDSG=C:\TEMP\CDSG
     This must be the name of an empty directory that will be used to store the
     files created and used.  Each file will contain just one short line of text
     so this directory will not take much room, even if it does contain many
     files.
  2. Copy the .BAT and .EXE files into a directory on your DOS path. Be sure
     this directory is not on the OS/2 path, or is at least after the directory
     used for the OS/2 CDSG files.
  3. Copy the .CMD files into a directory on your OS/2 path.
  4. To use immediately, you will now need to type the line shown in Step 1 in
     both an OS/2 and DOS command prompt. After you reboot, this will be done
     'automatically' for you.

To Use:
  At any command prompt, DOS or OS/2, you can save your current position (ie.
  current drive and path) by typing  CDS xxxx  where xxxx is any Name.

  The Name will be used as a filename. so follow the standard FAT restrictions
  when specifying a name for CDS.  If you use HPFS in OS/2, CDS in OS/2 will
  allow HPFS names to be used.  However, the DOS portion of CDSG will not be
  able to access them.

  At any time, at any prompt, from any directory, you may type  CDG xxxx  where
  xxxx is any Name that was previously stored. If it is available to you, you
  will be moved to the drive and directory that was current when xxxx was last
  saved.

  To see a list of what directories have been stored or saved, type CDLIST from
  DOS or OS/2.
